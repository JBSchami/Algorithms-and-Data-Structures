# Algorithms-and-Data-Structures

I am taking a course on algorithms and data structures during the fall of 2017. 
I learn by doing. Therefore to better understand the material taught in the 
class I have elected to implement my own data structures in C++.

Currently you will find implementations for the following:

* DATA STRUCTURES:
  * Singly Linked List
  * Doubly Linked List
  * Stack ADT
  * Queue ADT
  * Binary Tree

* ALGORITHMS:
