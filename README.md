# Algorithms-and-Data-Structures

I am taking a course on algorithms and data structures during the fall of 2017. 
I learn by doing. Therefore to better understand the material taught in the 
class I have elected to practice some implementations of my own data structures 
and algorithms in C++ and Java.
